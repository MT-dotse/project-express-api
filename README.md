# Express API Project ðŸŽ¥

The aim of the project was to create my first RESTful API using Node in Express. This API have series of endpoints which return both an array of data or a single object. In order to create the different enpoints I used javascript methods such as: find(), filter(), and slice(). To show the the API in use, I created a simple frontend. Overall a great learning experience to have built both the backend and frontend.
