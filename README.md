# Express API Project ðŸŽ¥

I created my first **RESTful** API using Express in Node. This API have series of endpoints which returns both a collection of data and single results. In order to create the different endpoints I used methods such as: **find(), filter(), and slice()**. To show the the API in use, I created a simple frontend. Overall a great learning experience to have built both the backend and frontend.
